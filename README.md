Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights / Customer Churn Prediction
Airbnb provides a platform for property owners to rent out their spaces to travelers. Pricing a
listing effectively is critical for maximizing revenue while staying competitive in the market.
For hosts, understanding what factors influence the price of their listings is essential.
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the price of Airbnb listings
based on various features such as property type, room type, location, amenities, and host
characteristics. By analyzing these factors, this project will provide actionable insights to
Airbnb hosts to optimize their listing prices.
